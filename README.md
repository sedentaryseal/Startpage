# Startpage

A startpage using HTML/CSS/JS. Can change background images and see a basic schedule.

# ToDo

* Use JS session storage to remember the current background image, so on refresh that same image is displayed

* Remove redundancy in JS code, e.g. defining the schedule items multiple times

* Bitcoin ticker

* HTML5 editable ToDo list

* Scan the /backgrounds folder for images, rather than having the number of images hardcoded

* Github feed of commits e.t.c.

# Bugs

* Cannot have more than 2 items in each day of the schedule, this is an easy fix
